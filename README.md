# Application-promoting-sustainability-awareness-across-society



Your selected topic is to Design an application that will allow people to volunteer in different activities that help our earth to stay clean, reduce wastes, go for green energy solutions …etc. This app allows two types of users namely for the initiators and the others are volunteers. The initiators can upload their events/suggested activities on the app along with the required details which are further available to the interested volunteers. Each initiative proposed by a user must be approved by a manager who should be able to judge if it is theme related or not.  If a certain event makes another user interested and they want to volunteer for it then they can register for that event and will be awarded some sustainability credit. 
In this project, you will design and implement a java based application using the Java Object Oriented Programming language. You are highly advised to apply the concepts you have learned in the course to design this project such as classes, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, arrays, lists, ..., etc. you will have multiple classes not less than three excluding the GUI classes. This application should have a well-designed interactive Graphical User interface and fulfill the following functionalities:

Admin:
1.	The Admin should have the following attributes: name, id, and password.
2.	The Admin can sign in and logout only. No sign up for technician. 
     The name is “admin” and the password is “admin2023”
3.	The admin should be able to approve or reject any suggested initiative that doesn’t meet the criteria.
4.	The initiative will only be listed after the admin approval.
5.	Admin can remove any registered initiative or initiator or volunteer.
6.	Admin should be able to see all initiatives and details on a tabular form.
7.	Admin should be able to search for an initiative or volunteer by name.
8.	The Admin should be able to view the details of each initiative or initiator or volunteer.
User
1.	A user must sign up at the first time of the application use to be able to login after.
2.	Any user can be an initiator or volunteer or both at the same time.
3.	The initiator is a user who initiated any initiative.
4.	A volunteer is any user who registered in volunteering in any registered initiatives other than his one.

6.	Any user should be able to edit his personal information at any time.
7.	The initiator should be able to add a new initiative, edit and delete any of his registered initiatives.
8.	 The deletion of the initiative should be possible before or after the admin approval. Both should be reflected in the system.
9.	The initiator should be able to View all the registered volunteers to his initiatives.
10.	The initiator shouldn’t be allowed to have more than two active initiatives at a time.
11.	The volunteer should be able to see all active initiatives once he log in with their details in a tabular format.
12.	A volunteer should be able to register to participate to any initiative that he likes.
13.	A volunteer should be able to withdraw at any time he wants before the initiative get expired.
14.	A volunteer should gain the points of the initiative participation once registered. Points will be deducted if he withdrawn.
15.	A volunteer should be able to generate a report of his volunteering history along with the total points in his record. 

The Initiative:
1.	The Initiative attributes are auto generated id, name, date, time, credit points, description and status (expired/active/pending). In addition to the imitator name and the volunteers list.
2.	If the initiative date and time are passed it should show that it is expired and shouldn’t allow any new volunteer registration.

h.	Others.

Files and Database:
1.	Files or Database system are to be used for saving all the records for all users, initiatives and all the related data.
2.	All data must be updated after every change in the records accordingly.
	Using API (+ 5 bonus Marks)
	Using Database instead of files (+5 bonus Marks)

At testing time make sure that:
	Prepare good testing samples. You have registered 5 Initiatives and around 20 Volunteers in the application with their dates, venues, points and details. While testing judges will try to add more items and more students. 
	Make sure you show all the scenarios in your testing.
